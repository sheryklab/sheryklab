## 👋🏻 Introducing Myself

I am Shery—an analyst with a background in design and early childhood education who now works on understanding problems through data. I focus on turning real questions into structured analysis, finding the patterns that explain what is happening, and building clear visuals that help others make decisions. My approach is simple: understand the problem, structure the data, answer the question, and communicate the insight.

### 📊 What I Do
- Clean, transform, and structure data for accurate analysis  
- Investigate datasets to answer real questions and uncover patterns  
- Build visualizations that explain results clearly and without noise  
- Create organized analytical workflows and relational data structures  
- Connect data findings back to the practical impact they represent  

I prefer projects where the goal is clarity, not complexity.
