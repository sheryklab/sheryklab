## 👋🏻 Introducing Myself

Hello, I am Shery. I come from a background in design and early childhood education, and I am now moving into data analysis with a focus on clarity, structure, and practical problem-solving. I am interested in how data can reveal patterns, explain behaviour, and improve everyday systems. I work by combining analysis, visualization, and careful organization to create outcomes that make sense.

### 📊 What I Do
- Clean, transform, and structure data so it can be understood  
- Explore datasets to find patterns and meaningful insights  
- Build visualizations that communicate information clearly  
- Create organized analytical workflows and relational structures  

I like projects where the goal is to understand a problem, not just display charts.

### 🔎 Recent Work
**Alberta Childcare Oversight Dashboard**  
A full analysis of provincial inspections, compliance trends, and enforcement data.

**Chores Quest**  
A relational task-tracking system designed around structure, logic, and progress tracking.  

*I keep expanding these projects to improve both the analytical depth and the storytelling behind the visuals.*
